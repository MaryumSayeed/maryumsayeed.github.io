I'm a graduate student at Columbia University in the Department of Astronomy, an [LSSTC Data Science Fellow](https://astrodatascience.org/) and a [National Osterbrock Leadership Fellow](https://aas.org/nolp). My research interests are primarily in **stellar astrophysics**, where I'm interested in studying stellar populations, discovering exoplanets, and understanding the formation and evolution of the Milky Way (read about my [Research](https://maryumsayeed.github.io/research/)). A full list of my research publications can be found [here](https://maryumsayeed.github.io/publications/), and my CV is available for download [here](https://maryumsayeed.github.io/cv/). I'm also passionate about outreach, in particular youth mentorship and astronomy education; detailed descriptions about my outreach efforts can be found in [Outreach](https://maryumsayeed.github.io/outreach/). After graduating from the University of British Columbia (UBC) in 2020, I worked as a Data Analytics Consultant at [Ernst & Young](https://www.ey.com/en_ca).
