I'm a graduate student at Columbia University in the Department of Astronomy, a [LSSTC Data Science Fellow](https://astrodatascience.org/) and a [National Osterbrock Leadership Fellow](https://aas.org/nolp). My [publications](https://maryumsayeed.github.io/publications/) and [CV](https://maryumsayeed.github.io/cv/) can be accessed using the tabs above. Outside of research, I'm passionate about [outreach](https://maryumsayeed.github.io/outreach/), in particular youth mentorship and astronomy education. I received my bachelors from the University of British Columbia in Physics & Astronomy, after which I worked as a Data Analytics Consultant at [Ernst & Young](https://www.ey.com/en_ca). <br>

### Research Interests

My research interests are primarily in **stellar astrophysics**. Broadly, I'm interested in studying stellar populations, discovering exoplanets, and understanding the formation and evolution of the Milky Way (read about my [Research](https://maryumsayeed.github.io/research/)). My current project involves using spectroscopic & photometric data from GALAH & TESS to investigate the lithium content in red giants. In the past, I've worked on asteroseismology - the study of stellar oscillations - where I've worked on creating a homogeneous catalog of asteroseismic detections in _Kepler_ short-cadence data. I'm the lead developer of [`The Swan`](https://github.com/MaryumSayeed/TheSwan), a data-driven technique to predict stellar surface gravities, and contributor of [`pySYD`](https://pysyd.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), an open-source Python package to measure global asteroseismic measurements.
