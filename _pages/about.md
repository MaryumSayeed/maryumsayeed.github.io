I am a fifth year Ph.D. student at Columbia University in the Department of Astronomy. During my Ph.D., I was a LSSTC Data Science Fellow and National Osterbrock Leadership Fellow, and received the Canadian Graduate Research Scholarship from [NSERC](https://www.nserc-crsng.gc.ca/Students-Etudiants/PG-CS/CGSD-BESCD_eng.asp). I received my bachelor's from the University of British Columbia in Physics & Astronomy, after which I worked as a Data Analytics Consultant at [Ernst & Young](https://www.ey.com/en_ca).<br>

## Research Interests

My research interests are in **stellar astrophysics**. Broadly, I'm interested in understanding the formation mechanisms of unsusual stellar populations. Similar to "Nature vs. Nurture" in Biology, I want to understand if chemically peculiar stars are a result of changes in a star's environement, or rapid proceses in stellar evolution. During my Ph.D., I focused on two populations of weird stars: lithium-rich red giants and solar-like stars without oscillations in _Kepler_. Read more about my [research](https://maryumsayeed.github.io/research/), or refer to my list of [publications](https://maryumsayeed.github.io/publications/) for my recent papers. I'm the lead developer of [The Swan](https://github.com/MaryumSayeed/TheSwan), a data-driven technique to predict stellar surface gravities, and contributor of [pySYD](https://pysyd.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), an open-source Python package to measure global asteroseismic parameters.
