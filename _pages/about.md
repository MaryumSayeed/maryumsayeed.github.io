I am a graduate student at Columbia University in the Department of Astronomy. I received my bachelor's from the University of British Columbia in Physics & Astronomy, after which I worked as a Data Analytics Consultant at [Ernst & Young](https://www.ey.com/en_ca). I am currently a [NSERC](https://www.nserc-crsng.gc.ca/Students-Etudiants/PG-CS/CGSD-BESCD_eng.asp) PGS-D fellow.<br>

## Research Interests

My research interests are primarily in **stellar astrophysics**. Broadly, I'm interested in studying stellar populations, discovering exoplanets, and understanding the formation and evolution of the Milky Way (read more about my [research](https://maryumsayeed.github.io/research/)). My current project involves using spectroscopic & photometric data from GALAH & TESS to investigate the lithium content in red giants. In the past, I've worked on asteroseismology - the study of stellar oscillations - where I've created a homogeneous catalog of asteroseismic detections in _Kepler_ short-cadence data. I'm the lead developer of [The Swan](https://github.com/MaryumSayeed/TheSwan), a data-driven technique to predict stellar surface gravities, and contributor of [pySYD](https://pysyd.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), an open-source Python package to measure global asteroseismic parameters.
