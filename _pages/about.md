I'm a first year PhD student at Columbia University in the Department of Astronomy. My research interests are primarily in stellar astrophysics (see [Research](https://maryumsayeed.github.io/research/)), where I'm interested in studying stellar populations, discovering exoplanets, and understanding the formation and evolution of the Milky Way. A full list of my research publications can be found [here](https://maryumsayeed.github.io/publications/), and my CV is available for download [here](https://maryumsayeed.github.io/cv/). I'm also passionate about outreach, in particular youth mentorship and astronomy education; detailed descriptions about my outreach efforts can be found in [Outreach](https://maryumsayeed.github.io/outreach/). After graduating from the University of British Columbia (UBC) in 2020, I worked as a Data Analytics Consultant at [Ernst & Young](https://www.ey.com/en_ca).
